# How does NetVOD work?
## First time on the website
When you arrive at NetVOD's website, you'll have two options: 
- either you have an account, you can log in and start watching videos.
- or you don't have an account, you can create one and start watching videos.

For the creation of your account, you'll have to give us your email address and a password (don't worry, we won't spam you, and your password is encrypted).
Once your account is created, you'll have to activate it by clicking on the link that appears on the page (it's a little red link).

## Want to watch a serie?
If you are log in, you will see the catalog, it's the list of all the series available on NetVOD. You can access a specific serie by clicking on it. You will then see the list of all the episodes available for this serie, and if you access and episode, you will see a video player.

## Cool features
On the home page, in the top right corner, you can see a profile icon. If you click on it, you will access your profile. You can modify a few things:
- your name
- your surname
- your birthdate
- add a biography
